# rhythm-generator
My personal project that generates random rhythm exercises

Useful for producing clapping exercises for students or to test your own rhythmic accuracy

## **How to Use:**

Simply run main.py and enter the difficulty of the exercise and the number of bars to create

Press generate and window will open with the exercise

The exercise can also be saved or printed


## **Running the Code:**

This program has a few dependencies which need to be installed

[wxPython](https://wxpython.org/) is used for the GUI\
Install with `pip install -U wxPython`  

[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) is used for the creation of the sheet music\
Download the installer from [here](http://lilypond.org/download.html)


## **Future Plans:**

*Add more time signatures (currently only outputs in 4/4)
*Add more rhythm patterns
*Add the ability to change time signatures during the exercise
*Add support for ties
*Add a playback feature which can demonstrate the correct rhythms
*Add the abilty to generate multiple exercises in one document
*Add cross-platform support: PDFWindow from wxPython only supports Windows
