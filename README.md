# rhythm-generator
My personal project that generates random rhythm exercises

Useful for producing clapping exercises for students or to test your own rhythmic accuracy

Simply run main.py and enter the difficulty of the exercise and the number of bars to create

Press generate and window will open with the exercise

The exercise can also be saved or printed


## **Running the Code:**

This program has a few dependencies which need to be installed

[wxPython](https://wxpython.org/) is used for the GUI

Install with `pip install -U wxPython`\


[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) is used for the creation of the exercise document

Download the installer from [here](http://lilypond.org/download.html).
